# MERN eLearning Website - Data Storage and CSP (AWS)

This repository contains the backend implementation for a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) based eLearning platform. The project focuses on data storage and cloud service provider (CSP) integration using Amazon Web Services (AWS).

### Features:
- **Data Storage**: Utilizes MongoDB for scalable, flexible data storage to manage user profiles, course materials, quizzes, and progress tracking.
- **Cloud Integration (AWS)**: The platform leverages AWS services such as S3 for file storage, EC2 for hosting the backend, and RDS for managed databases, ensuring high availability and performance.
- **Secure User Authentication**: User login and registration flow is handled with JWT tokens, providing secure access control to different parts of the application.
- **File Management**: Course content, such as videos, documents, and assignments, are uploaded and stored in AWS S3 buckets.
- **Scalable and Robust**: The platform is built to scale with ease, using AWS cloud infrastructure to handle large amounts of data and user requests efficiently.

### Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB (via AWS MongoDB Atlas or self-hosted)
- **Cloud Services**: Amazon Web Services (AWS) - EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda

### Installation:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up your AWS credentials and configure necessary services like S3 and RDS.
3. Run the backend with Node.js and the frontend with React.
4. Follow the setup instructions for MongoDB to connect to the database.

### Usage:
This project can be extended to include features like live video sessions, notifications, advanced user roles, and interactive assessments.
